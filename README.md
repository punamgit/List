# List
'List' is an android app that helps create and manage lists in your day-to-day life. 
I started making this app to help keep track of lists that I had to create using pen and paper.

In the app, you can create multiple lists. Every list can have multiple items. 
You can add due dates to your list items. You can check the completed items.
You can group lists by tagging them to groups, and can view all the lists tagged to the same group. 
A list can be tagged to different groups. This helps see the same list in different contexts.
Deleting a group tag does not delete the list. You can delete lists you don'tneed anymore.

Important Use Cases - 
1. Add a new list. Add items to the list. 
2. Delete items from a list by swiping.
3. Add due date and details to an item in a list.
4. Check an item as done. 
5. View the items under different tabs - All, Completed, Pending.
6. Delete an existing list by swiping. Also check undo of a swipe.
7. Create a new group in the Navigation Drawer.
8. Add a list to a new group.
9. Delete a group in the Navigation Drawer(Just deletes group name, and does not delete the lists in the group).
